# Edge SIG

## Introduction

Enabling the future of edge computing through NextArch developers focuses on edge-aware applications, such as the development and application of geo-distribution systems. Accelerate innovation in edge-aware technologies to enable seamless interoperability of edge clouds, provide end-to-end edge stacks for vertical emerging scenarios, and build bridges between end-users and technology providers.

## Responsibilities

- Clarify landscape
  - IoT
  - Gaming
  - Connected Car
  - VR/AR
  - AI
- High level use case examples and public tools:
  - As an application developer, I can have high performance communications between data source and processing unit.
  - As an application developer, I get to deal with large volumes of high frequency event data.
  - As an application developer, I can connect users from different locations for great communication experiences on presence data.
  - As an application developer, I can easily experiment with the WebTransport protocol rather than self-build the entire complex environment.
- Documented design patterns and failure examples:
  - Edge aware systems usage.
  - Using Geo-distributed systems to handle data mining and complex data syncing   causes poor performance for developers.
- White paper example topics:
  - A white paper describing how to enable low-latency global scale communication for metaverse applications.
  - A white paper describing how to enable web-based metaverse applications with high performance at a global scale.
  - A white paper documenting practical uses of Serverless and Functions as an Edge-aware Service
